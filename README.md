# SAST Scanning Project

## Overview

This project implements Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify and remediate vulnerable code. Using CodeQL, we run automated scans that present results in a user-friendly manner within the GitHub UI, enhancing engineers' understanding of vulnerabilities and enabling effective remediation.

## Key Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Automatically scans code for vulnerabilities using CodeQL.
- **User-Friendly Results**: Displays scan results directly in the GitHub UI, making it easy for engineers to understand and address issues.
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Provides detailed information about each vulnerability, helping engineers to learn and improve their coding practices.
- **Remediation Guidance**: Offers actionable insights to help engineers quickly remediate identified vulnerabilities.

## Implementation

1. **Setup CodeQL**: Configure CodeQL within your GitHub repository to enable automated scanning.
2. **Run Automated Scans**: CodeQL scans your codebase for vulnerabilities every time changes are pushed.
3. **View Results**: Scan results are presented in a clear, user-friendly format within the GitHub UI.
4. **Remediate Vulnerabilities**: Engineers can review detailed information and guidance on how to fix identified vulnerabilities.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Security**: Identifies vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, preventing potential security issues in production.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Encourages best practices and continuous learning for engineers.
- **Efficient Remediation**: Streamlines the process of addressing vulnerabilities, reducing downtime and enhancing security.

## Conclusion

By integrating CodeQL for automated SAST scanning, this project ensures a secure and efficient development process. Engineers gain valuable insights into vulnerabilities, enabling them to produce secure and high-quality code.
