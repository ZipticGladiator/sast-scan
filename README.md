# SAST Scanning Project

## Overview

This project implements Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify and remediate vulnerable code. Using CodeQL, we run automated scans that present results in a user-friendly manner within the GitHub UI, enhancing engineers' understanding of vulnerabilities and enabling effective remediation.

Additionally, we have integrated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) using Trivy to scan Docker images for any vulnerabilities. This dual approach of SAST and SCA ensures a comprehensive security posture by addressing both code and dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Automatically scans code for vulnerabilities using CodeQL.
- **Software Composition Analysis**: Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for dependency vulnerabilities.
- **User-Friendly Results**: Displays scan results directly in the GitHub UI, making it easy for engineers to understand and address issues.
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Provides detailed information about each vulnerability, helping engineers to learn and improve their coding practices.
- **Remediation Guidance**: Offers actionable insights to help engineers quickly remediate identified vulnerabilities.

## Implementation

1. **Setup CodeQL**: Configure CodeQL within your GitHub repository to enable automated scanning.
2. **Setup Trivy**: Configure Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
3. **Run Automated Scans**: CodeQL scans your codebase for vulnerabilities, and Trivy scans your Docker images every time changes are pushed.
4. **View Results**: Scan results are presented in a clear, user-friendly format within the GitHub UI.
5. **Remediate Vulnerabilities**: Engineers can review detailed information and guidance on how to fix identified vulnerabilities.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Security**: Identifies vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, preventing potential security issues in production.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses both code vulnerabilities and dependency vulnerabilities in Docker images, providing a holistic security approach.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Encourages best practices and continuous learning for engineers.
- **Efficient Remediation**: Streamlines the process of addressing vulnerabilities, reducing downtime and enhancing security.

## Security Posture Enhancement

By integrating SAST with CodeQL and SCA with Trivy, we ensure a robust security framework. This combination allows for:

- **Early Detection and Mitigation**: Discovering vulnerabilities in both code and dependencies before they reach production.
- **Detailed Insights**: Providing engineers with comprehensive information on vulnerabilities, improving their understanding and ability to fix issues.
- **Strengthened Security Posture**: Reducing the risk of security breaches by addressing multiple layers of potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

By integrating CodeQL for automated SAST scanning and Trivy for SCA scanning, this project ensures a secure and efficient development process. Engineers gain valuable insights into vulnerabilities, enabling them to produce secure and high-quality code, while also safeguarding dependencies used in Docker images.
